## 🧪 How to Run Locally

> ⚠️ Requires [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to be installed.

1. Copy the project folder into your `htdocs/` directory inside XAMPP.
2. Place sample `.mp4` or `.webm` videos into the `/videos` folder.
3. Run Apache from XAMPP Control Panel.
4. In your browser, navigate to:  
   👉 `http://localhost/MediaStream-Pro/home2.php`
5. You should see a grid/list of videos, each with a thumbnail and player.
6. Click to play videos directly in the browser.

## 🧠 Notes

- FFmpeg must be installed and added to your system PATH if using `generate-thumbnail.php`.
- No MySQL or database setup is required — the app works by scanning the filesystem.
- The `home2.php` file handles:
  - Directory scanning
  - Pagination
  - Video rendering
